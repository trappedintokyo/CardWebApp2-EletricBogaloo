Changes 4/15
- player limit to 4 per game
- player num and starting hand cannot be adjusted after game has started
- added an end game button, will clear the chat and set new game to false
- server runs constant checks on the settings html to dynamically change max starting hand value based on # players
- player number and game details are stored on server - can safely close out setting page wo ending game - must manually end game or server
- default title - custom title max 25 characters
- player names dynamically change; added to the playerName string array in index5.js - displays "empty" if the player spot is not filled
- cannot create game while one is in progress - must end game to create a new one
	- the button function changes to reflect this - all in one button
- created a real time calculation on the starting hand so the max of the num input changes based on the current player count even before game creation
	- if the value is too high for the current player number, it will set the value to the highest possible
	- error message kept just in case because of the one second delay
- connected a new cards.js to the index5.js - changed the string array into Card object pointers with value and suite variables.
	- myDeck.deck[*index*].value and myDeck.deck[*index*].suite to access
- the error returns in index.html changed from if to switch statement
- working shuffle method. call using myDeck.shuffle();
	- check shuffle in console log using
		console.log(myDeck.deck); // the deck in order
		myDeck.shuffle(); // call shuffle
		console.log(myDeck.deck); // deck after shuffle
- myDeck points to a new Deck object and reshuffles on /create
- player hand is generated and sent once the player document.ready if starting hand is > 0
	- draws the same way as irl - from the index 0 (top) of the pile
	- this data is saved in the server upon creation (/player2)
	- if the game has not ended yet, the player will rejoin with their previous hand - saves all the player's hands
		- this can be changed to not save data later on
- draw card method appears to be working - not sure what to do when the deck is empty
- draw button will disable if there's no cards left
- the unchangable values on the settings screen will disable when the game starts
4/19-------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed the player index bug as best I could
- added the show hand which updates to the most current hand
	- showId is the first index to be added to the shown hand array;
- added routes.js to handle requests
4/21-------------------------------------------------------------
- infinite mode is working- cards in discard will replace to main constantly as long as discard isnt empty
- shuffle on replace is also working - cards from discard will be shuffled into the main pile
Need:
- a draw card button, table button, and discard along with all their functions
	- store player hand in an array within an array - accessable to players via their id
- a canvas that is set to display 3 players and yourself - interactable only in 3 sections
	- should draw the appropriate cards in the right order based on the 
- player names change according to each player's own nameset
- discard pile and main pile - change main to draw card and discard to send only
	- create the differnt functions - once the main is empty (main.length = 0) take all cards in the discard pile
	and put back into main - also call a reshuffle method
- create a send to table button while kayla makes a click and drag canvas function - choose the perferred method
- erase player index data like the cards they have when they leave - send their cards to the main when they leave
	- if someone joins in their place - give them a new random hand if at all possible OR dont clear data and save until new game
Want:
- custom deck - setting the numbers of each card type
- joker checkbox - in case a game wants jokers, it'll add 2 to the list
- password on settings that can be set once the server is run - prevents someone from ruining the game midway
